Treesitter is a powerful parser generator tool and incremental parsing library that provides advanced syntax highlighting, code folding, and structural text editing capabilities.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Traditional syntax highlighting in Neovim:

- Is regex-based and often inaccurate
- Can be slow for large files
- Doesn't understand code structure
- Lacks advanced features like intelligent code folding

## How It Improves Productivity

1. **Better Syntax Highlighting**:

   - More accurate highlighting
   - Faster performance
   - Better handling of complex syntax
   - Support for many languages

2. **Advanced Code Features**:

   - Intelligent code folding
   - Structural text editing
   - Better code navigation
   - Improved code understanding

3. **Language Support**:
   - Extensive language support
   - Easy to add new languages
   - Better handling of embedded languages
   - Consistent highlighting across languages

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

- Syntax highlighting works automatically
- Use `:TSInstall <language>` to install a language parser
- Use `:TSUpdate` to update all parsers
- Use `:TSBufInfo` to see current buffer info

### Code Folding

- Use `zc` to fold at current node
- Use `zo` to unfold
- Use `zR` to unfold all
- Use `zM` to fold all

### Navigation

- Use `]c` to go to next class
- Use `]f` to go to next function
- Use `]i` to go to next if statement
- Use `]p` to go to next parameter

### Text Objects

- Use `viw` for inner word
- Use `vif` for inner function
- Use `vic` for inner class
- Use `via` for inner argument
