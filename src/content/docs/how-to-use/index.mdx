This guide focuses on Neovim-specific features, plugin usage, and configuration best practices. For basic Vim commands and navigation, please refer to the [Vim Cheatsheet](/vim/cheatsheet).

We have converted most of the key-bindings that are compatible with Neovim in the [Vim Cheatsheet](/vim/cheatsheet).

> In most modern editors like VS Code, a "tab" represents an open file. In Vim/Neovim, this concept is called a "buffer" - which is an in-memory representation of a file. When we refer to Buffer(Tab) in the keybindings below, we mean switching between open files, similar to switching tabs in other editors.

**Quick Definitions:**

- **Buffer**: A buffer is the in-memory text of a file being edited. Multiple buffers can exist for different files.
- **Tab**: In Vim, a tab is actually a collection of windows arranged in a specific layout. This is different from the "tabs" concept in modern editors.
